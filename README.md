## ChaBot

This is our own fork of hubot, for use on #chadevelopers in
freenode. This repo serves two purposes. One, if you're looking to
talk to #cha developers hit up #chadevelopers on freenoe
(irc.freenode.org).

Second, I'm trying to add functionality such as searchable history,
event reminders, other fun stuff to the room, and I never get to write
coffee script, so this should be a fun project for us.

# Hubot

Hubot is a chat bot, modeled after GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty
cool. He's extendable with
[community scripts](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts) and your own custom
scripts, and can work on [many different chat services](docs/adapters.md).

This repository provides a library that's distributed by `npm` that you
use for building your own bots.  See the [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)
for details on getting up and running with your very own robot friend.

In most cases, you'll probably never have to hack on this repo directly if you
are building your own bot. But if you do, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
